## There is NO perfect software development process for all projects

The road to hell is paved with dogmatists for 'the one true agile method' that works for everything. Remember that most agile methodologies were developed by professional services shops that primarily tackled projects of a constrained range of scope, complexity and client profile. The reality is that as a CPO, you have projects -all critical- that will range greatly in complexity, certainty of inital requirements, and time sensitivity. You need to understand (and predict) the relative density of different work profiles. Then you need to ensure that you have a well-socialized agreement with your tech partners on the set of processes and team structures that will best set up the teams for success. An SDLC process could be super well optimized for a typical medium sized feature effort. But that same process would be gross overkill for a quick low-risk bug fix. At the same time as being dangerously underkill for a larger epic project like a risky major platform migration.

Let your project priorities dictate the SLDC processes your organization needs. Never the other way around!

## Project Management and Planning

## Architecture

You don't need to be an experienced architect to be a product manager, but it doesn't hurt. If nothing else, experience in product management will inevitably bring you no shortage of hard lessons over time in the value of good architecture. Not that you'll *ever* have the perfect software architecture. At the very least, you'll have a better time if you and team are at least somewhat aware of what an ideal solution might look like. Know the rules before you break them and all that.

Goals for architecture. It's not just about engineering a solution that works. It's about a solution that's also going to be sufficiently scaleable, extensible, maintainable, secure, reliable, resuable etc. Think through all of these considerations, but then also remember the key is 'sufficiently'. Unfortunately, expediency or realworld constraints will force you and your tech partners to make architectural tradeoffs. You're are doing well though when you are making those tradeoffs intentionally.
