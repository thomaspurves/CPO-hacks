# Feature Name
Use this template to take an insight or problem statement to a minimum level of solution definition, before deciding if, how, and when to proceed with solving it. 
**Instructions**  Provide just enough detail to negotiate the scope of the function of this feature and establish a preliminary sizing-estimate - in order to inform roadmap prioritization, before greenlighting or planning further work on detail specifications and execution. In an ideation phase, the goal is not to fully specify every detail, but rather to make sure that overal complexity can be mutually understood. At which point healthy discusion on trade-offs on scope, asumptions or different solution approaches etc can still happen. Swag and prioritize early and often. 

## Business Goal Alignment:
- Who is the customer for this feature (e.g. could be end customers, partner/ecosystem customer, internal customer)
- What potential share or number of those customers will this feature benefit? (e.g. everyone or a sub-segment?)
- How much benefit will it bring for those customers?

### Why else does this matter to our organization (optional)
Why does this matter? How does this help us achieve our product strategy and ultimately company vision? Does this feature have aditional strategic or tactical value?

### Core Problem(s)
What customer, partner or internal problems are we solving for?

### Outcome
What is the bet or hypotheses we are making? By what metric will you measure if it's working?

### Constraints & Dependencies
This includes dependencies on other teams, cost, release windows, or even platform versions.

### Alternatives to building this feature
What are the next best alternatives and most likely outcomes if we donâ€™t build this feature?
- Alternative 1: e.g., Status quo
- Alternative 2: e.g., Temporary workaround or partial solution

### Key dates (optional)
Are there any important dates or deadlines to be aware of? These could be hard dates like compliance deadlines, firm dates like client or contractual commitments, or softer projections such as approaching scaling limits of current systems or manual processes.

### How will it work
Concise description of the proposed solution.

### Primary Requirements
Outline top-level requirements or major user stories (keep it higher level, if/once this feature is prioritized, these may be broken down further into more granular stories or sub-features as needed). Do include any specific expectations you have for negative cases / exception handling, not just the happy path.

| Requirement/User story | Key acceptance criteria | Priority | Notes |
|------------------------|-------------------------|----------|-------|
|                        |                         |          |       |

### Sketches or Diagrams (optional)
Outline high-level concepts and flows to provide additional direction. 
Provide wireframe sketches if available.
Link to a miro or figjam user journey map.

### Risks (optional)
What are the biggest risks associated with this feature either in execution or in production. Do these risks have mitigations or controls?

### Open Questions (optional)
| Question | Next steps + owner | Priority | Notes |
|----------|--------------------|----------|-------|
|          |                    |          |       |

### Non-functional Requirements (optional)
Besides the primary functons/user journeys, what other supporting complexity is going to require effort, that we can make sure to included in scoping and estimating.  
Does this feature have specific performance or capacity requirements or considerations?
Does this feature have specific reporting or instrumentation requirements that should be called out?
Testing/QA requirements, any test data sets or test tools that need to be sourced or developed that could add to scope?

### Out of Scope
What can you simplify the ask, manage expectations by marking explicitly out of scope for this iteration of the feature?
